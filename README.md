# Clear Inventory Filters

This simple QoL mod adds a button to the player inventory which clears all filters. Only affects main inventory slots and not mecha logistics slots.

I made this because I constantly found myself constantly accidentally creating filters with middle-mouse ingame, which were a hassle to deal with when I wanted to sort my inventory. Therefore, button!

I hope you enjoy this mod. It is clientside so it is compatible with NebulaMultiplayerMod.
